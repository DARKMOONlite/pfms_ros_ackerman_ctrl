Quiz 4
======

Part A
------

**PREAMBLE**

We have been provided an implementation of the `Controller` and `Quadcopter` classes from Assignment 1. The functionality has been implemented across the base class `Controller` and derived class `Quadcopter`, while there are some errors in the code that prevent it from running correctly. 	

The quiz  has been developed against an updated **Pipes** library ( version 1.1.0 ). You will find the package for the update in `skeleton/a2_support` folder. To install it `sudo dpkg -i pipes-1.1.0-Linux.deb` . In particular we use a new library called `linkcommand` which is distributed with the updated package and allows to control the `Ackerman` and `Quadcopter` position is simulation and move them about (teleport then to places in an instance.) 

We have been provided some tests to let us debug, isolate and fix issues in Quadcopter. The unit tests are in [`utest.cpp` in ./a1/test folder](./a1/test/utest.cpp)` and they can be run from build directory via `./test/utest` and you can also find them in Qtcreator (select `utest to run). There are two tests provided in the `QuadcopterTest` suite, one for TASK 1 and the other for TASK 2.  Before running the unit tests make sure you have run the simulator `roslaunch gazebo_tf uav.launch`. 

**TASK 1 - Initialisation of variables**

All member variables belonging to the class need to be initialised to default values. When we have a base and derived class the initialisation can occur in either the [Base Class Constructor (Controller)](./a1/controller.cpp)  or the [Derived Class Constructor (Quadcopter)](./a1/quadcopter.cpp) .  Initialise the variables in the appropriate constructor so that the `Constructor` tests pass. 

HINT: Check what is being tested in `Contrsuctor` test, look where the variables exist and consider where they should be initialised. Consider that you would also have another derived class `Ackerman`.  

**TASK 2 - Reaching Goal function**

The function  [reachGoal in Quadcopter](./a1/quadcopter.cpp) is not implemented completely. We need to compute the control of total velocity `TARGET_SPEED`, which should be divided into the left/right and forward/backward velocity. To compute how we control the platform we can use the orientation of the platform `odo_.yaw` and the `target_angle_` which tells us where we should be heading. Currently when running 

Compute the correct control value and send the correct command. This will enable completion of `Goals` test which visits two goals.

At present the `reachGoal` will terminate, if we have not reached the goal within 2s of the estimated time. This prevents the code from running infinitely and is a wise move (make a bound by which your code should stop execution).

**TASK 3 - Compute time travelled**

The code should update the total time travelled `time_travelled_` it fails to do this currently. Look at how we compute whether to abort `reachGoal ` as you could use the same function for this task. Also, consider, if we aborted the function `reachGoal`, should we update the time travelled? 

**TASK 4 - Compute distance travelled**

While the estimated distance at the beginning is a rough guide, as the platform moves it could travel more than anticipated (estimated), especially if it  was going against wind (or in case of Ackerman if it was drifting). A better way to computer the distance travelled is increment `distance_travelled_` as you go along.  Also, consider, if we aborted the function `reachGoal`, should we update the distance travelled thus far?  


Part B
-------

The code supplied has two ROS nodes and uses Week09 pre-work. Refer to Week09 module on canvas. We assume you have

* Installed ROS (you can skip this if your using our VM) or have done so for Assignment 1.
* Creating catkin_ws (again, should have done for Assignment 1).
* Compiling our week09 begginer tutorials (adding them to your catkin workspace) - refer Module 09 on canvas.

You will now need to add the quiz4 part a2 once only inside your catkin workspace (my git is ~/git/pfms-2022a-alalemp change for your location of your git ), this is a one of process.

```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
ln -s ~/git/pfms-2022a-alalemp/quizzes/quiz4/a2 
```

Whenever you need to compile your code you need to be in folder `~/catkin_ws/`and if so, you can compile via `catkin_make` command, and this is done every time you change the code.

To run the two nodes through ROS  (`talker` and `quiz4_a2`) you need roscore running in one terminal via command `roscore`

```
rosrun beginner_tutorials talker
rosrun quiz4_a2 quiz4_a2_listener
```

To check the unit test you run

```bash
rosrun quiz4_a2 utest
```

We need to implement two functions in  [analysis](./a2/src/analysis.h) 

**TASK 1 - Count characters**

Counts the number of characters in the string supplied (for instance "foo" has 3 characters) 

**TASK 2 - Detect integer in string**

Detects a integer number which is part of the string supplied, detects the first number in the string (for instance "Tommy has 13 cats and 5 dogs" detects 13 as the number.)
