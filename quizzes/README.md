Quizzes

This folder is reserved for quizes.
* Quiz content will be updated throughout semester by staff 
* You will provide your answers to quizes in the same folder the quiz has been provided
* Feedback for in-class discussion (quiz review) will be provided

**DO NOT move the quiz code anywhere, work on your solutions to the quiz directly over the code provided and push this to your repo. If the code is not pushed to the remote it will not be marked. A script will examine the changes to the quiz folder to determine if it should be marked**

Each quiz folder has

Each review folder has
