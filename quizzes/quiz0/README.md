Part A1
------

Declarations of functions exists in [arrays.h](./a/arrays.h). You will be implementing the functions in [arrays.cpp](./a1/arrays.cpp) and using them in [main.cpp](./a/main.cpp)

1) TASK: Implement function `assignArrayToVector`that assigns elements of array `x` to a vector named `vec`

2) TASK: Implement function `removeNumbersLargerThan` that accepts vector `myVec` and removes elements of `myVec` greater than a `limit`

3) TASK: Implement function `computeMeanAndStdDev` that computes the mean and standard deviation of `myVec` and returns the `Stats` structure with these values. You will find [Stats structure in arrays.h](./a/arrays.h)

4) TASK: Implement function `returnVecWithNumbersSmallerThan` that returns a vector containing elements of `myVec` vector that are less than `limit`.


Part A2
------
Your code will not compile until all functions of the `Sample` class are implemented.

1) TASK: Add the special member function (the Constructor) to the declaration of the `Sample` class [sample.h](./a2/sample.h). The constructor needs to take a double value as a parameter and assign this value to the member variable `value_`.

2) TASK: Implement the methods of the Sample class in the [sample.cpp](./a2/sample.cpp) file based on the definition provided in [sample.h](./a/sample.h).
