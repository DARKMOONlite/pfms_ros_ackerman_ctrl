# Refer canvas Week 04 - Unit Tests to install the unit testing framework if you wish
#
# We have only provided one example, whereas on submission we will test every function you develop
# To enable testsing you need to pass a switch to cmake
# cmake .. -DBUILD_TESTS=ON
# then run make as usual
# finally, tests can be run from build directory (for this example ./test/utest
