Organisation
------------------------------------
This repository is organised in 4 folders:

* [quizzes](./quizzes) - Quiz questions and related skeleton code. You will need to complete the coding exercises in this folder (in place of existing code) and then `commit` and `push` your responses here. You will also receive feedback to quizzes in this folder.
* [scratch](./scratch) - Your own private folder, to back-up your code and assignments

The following two folder are best not to be edited, staff will update contents during the semester and editing can create very tricky conflicts to resolve. PLEASE copy the content to scratch and then edit/make changes.

* [skeleton](./skeleton) - Skeleton code to be used for assignments 

* [tutorials](./tutorials) - Tutorial questions, skeleton code and solutions 

You can create additional folders if you want.

Tips
------------------------------------
* **Use the scratch folder** for any of your own work on in-class material and assignments
* **AVOID editing the tutorials folder otherwise you may encounter git merge conflicts.** Instead copy the folders/files needed into your scratch folder and thereafter edit them and commit
