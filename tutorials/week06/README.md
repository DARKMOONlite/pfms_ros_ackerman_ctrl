"With great power comes great responsibility"; the phrase dates back to the French revolution and is popularised by the Spiderman series. In programming circles, it is related to the concept of threading. 

Threads are essential for modern processors to keep up with the many tasks. As you read this now, you could probably be running a dozen or so threads running on your device. The capacity to run threads is what differentiates systems on chip from simple micro-controllers. We will introduce threading in the subject this week, together with tools that let you mitigate data access and coordinate it between threads.
