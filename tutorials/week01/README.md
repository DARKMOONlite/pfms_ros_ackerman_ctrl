Week 1 Information
=========================

Please refer to canvas for video's to assist in conjunction with the exercises.

First and foremost, the subject is delivered on Linux OS (Ubuntu) so we initially discuss circumnavigating Linux. Then we move to CMake, which is the build system used (this let's you compile code and create libraries and executables). We then also introduce QTCreator as Integrated Development Environment (that you write code in).

It is *ESSENTIAL* you have Linux installed and have compiled our sample code to be able to partake in Week 01 activities.

Attempting pre-work enables students to partake in class. To understand a concept you will need to reflect on it, you will need to have been introduced to it to reflect on the concept. Therefore, seeing a concept for the very first time in class will not be effective. 

Pre-work is refresher of concepts you have covered thus far in your course: pointers, arrays and loops.

Week 1 Tutorial Questions
=========================

In the tutorial we will cover other essentials concepts that you should have covered thus far in your course: functions, structs and enums. All of these are basics of C and will be used in C++.

We introduce one concept from C++, that we will use extensively going forward, a vector. Vectors belong to the Standard Template Library (STD) that is part of C++ suite of libraries. With this, our journey into C++ features begins in week 1!
