Week 9 
=========================

We assume you have installed ROS and set-up your catkin workspace as per canvas Week 09 pre-work instructions. This is needed both for quiz4 as well as tutorial this week.

A little bit of history here, in 2007 a group of Engineers at Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory were working on a middle-ware for Robotics. There was no such system wildly used at the time, despite Robotics taking on and DARPA funnelling money into Autonomy in Robotics (check out the [DARPA Grand Challenge](https://www.darpa.mil/about-us/timeline/darpa-urban-challenge), both Rob and myself were part of the competition in the Sydney-Berkeley TEAM : We used a middle-ware called [ICE by ZeroC](https://zeroc.com/) which was part of [ORCA](http://orca-robotics.sourceforge.net/orca_doc_overview.html)). 

The engineers at Stanford coined the term ROS, for Robotics Operating Systems. However, ROS is not an [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) (your running Linux - that is an OS). Rather ROS is [software framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework) that embodies the idea of Component Based Software Engineering (CBSE). 

The group development moved out of University, securing venture capital from investors in Google and continued in a startup [Willow Garage](http://www.willowgarage.com/). 

ROS is a software framework for software development, it has middleware designed for heterogeneous computer clusters, such as [hardware abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_abstraction), low-level [device control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_driver), implementation of commonly used functionality (libraries), [message-passing between processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication), and package management.
