Week 3 Tutorial Questions
=========================
Work through these questions to understand what is going on in each example. If you have any questions about the material please raise them in the next tutorial session.

Inheritance - Ex01
--------------------

Refer to base class `Shape` and implement:

* `Rectangle` as a derived class of `Shape`
* Implement the special member function in `Rectangle` ... which one is it? Make this function require a width and height to be specified
* Can we also make a function that allows only one side to be supplier as to create a square?

Consider: Which members (data/methods) should belong to the base class and which to the derived class.

Inheritance - Ex02
---------------------

Building upon your previous solution. 

* Create a `Circle` class, implement constructor and methods that are missing
* Create a `Triangle` class (assuming Isosceles triangle), implement constructor and methods that are missing
* Implement `setCentre` and `offsetCentre` methods.

Consider: Where should this function be placed (both the declaration and implementation)?


Inheritance - Ex03
------------------

Building upon your previous solution.

* Write a program that accepts a point *(x,y location)* and displays if a shape intersects that point (the point is within the area of the shape)?

Consider: Where should this function be placed (both the declaration and implementation)?


Inheritance - Ex04
------------------

Building upon your previous solution.

* Create a Rectangle and Triangle. Can we store both of them in one vector?
* After solving the previous point, write a program that accepts a point *(x,y location)* and displays all shapes that intersect that point (the point is within the area of the shape)?

Consider: What will be the type for this vector? Are there any issues with completing item 2 here?
